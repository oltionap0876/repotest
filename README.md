To make a repo:

First, go to Github, sign in, and click on the + sign and then click on new repository.

Then, create the repo name your teacher informed you to put, and click on create repo.

After, go to your ide, and pwd to make sure you are at /home/ubuntu

After you made sure that you are in the right place, cd github-learning(or whatever github you are doing at the moment.)

Then make a directory that you need(for ex: mkdir ABC), and then create it(cd ABC)

Then, before you write anything else, make sure to git init, so you initialize everything.

After git init, you want to make a file that you could write all information needed, so you touch ABC.md(example), and then open the file(c9 (whatever file you made)) 

When you open the file you created, you write down all info that is necessary.

After you wrote that all info that was needed, you git add(the file that you were in)

Then you git commit -m and write a message explaining what you were doing(for ex: I wrote ABC)

Finally, you git push to make sure everything goes on github.
